Thief II: The Metal Age Multiplayer
===================================

Overview
--------
This is an unofficial patch for Thief II: The Metal Age (T2) which updates the game with multiplayer
functionality. Consider it to be in beta state. There are various issues and things that don't work,
and don't expect it to work with all FMs or with Thief 1/Gold. If you're looking for a fully working
multiplayer experience then this is not for you. Bugs and improvements may or may not be addressed in
the future.

This patch is made available "as is" and without warranty of any kind. It was not developed by
Eidos/Square Enix, Looking Glass Studios, GOG, Steam, Mastertronic, or Amazon, and is neither
supported nor endorsed by them or anyone else. The aforementioned parties cannot be held responsible
for any problems or damages incurred by this software. If you do not agree with these terms then do
not apply the update.

T2 and its resources/executables are the property of Eidos/Square Enix.

Permission is granted to any party that has obtained the legal rights to sell the original (v1.18 or
earlier) game, such as GOG and Steam, to include this update, as long as they also have been granted
permission by Eidos/Square Enix to do so.


Installation
------------
You should have a valid game install with the latest v1.28 update before installing the multiplayer files.
You can just extract the contents of "mp.zip" into the game's root directory and run "Thief2MP.exe".

Extracting "mp.zip" will overwrite some original OSM files with multiplayer compatible versions. These
updated OSMs still work with the singleplayer game. If you're not comfortable with that, you can make
a separate copy of your entire game directory and install multiplayer in the copy instead. That way
you have dedicated single- and multi-player installs.

The MP package comes with "dark_net.bnd" that contains additional key bindings specifically for multiplayer,
and "dark_net.cfg" which is a config file only loaded by the multiplayer EXE. You can edit these in a
text editor.

All players in a game session should always make sure to run the same version of the game, and ideally
use the same mod configuration.

The MP package also contains the file "GlobalServer.zip" which holds Windows binaries and cross-
platform source code for the global/master server software. The global server is a server that
maintains a list of publicly available game hosts that can be viewed with the game's built-in server
browser. The contents of this ZIP is only relevant for those who intend to run a global server, otherwise
you can ignore it.

If you want to enable the game's server browser or host public games, and you have the address to an
available global server, then open "dark_net.cfg" in a text editor and set the "global_server_name"
variable to that address. You can also set a default player name, host name or host address in the
same config file.

Multiplayer savegames are located in the directory "netsaves". Inside "netsaves" are sub-directories
named after the server name, containing the savegame files. That means if you plan on playng with saving
that you should keep track of the server names used/joined and avoid the same server name for different
playthroughs. Failing to do so can lead to savegame mismatches or accidental overwrites.

The game host uses the network port 5198.


Notes on Playing
----------------

An alive player can revive dead players by frobbing them. It's not game over until all players are dead.

If you want to chat with other players, by text or voice, you'll have to use an external chat application.

As mentioned above, do not expect a fully working game. Issues can range from smaller glitches to certain
mission(s) having special case completion conditions that are not fully multiplayer compatible, resulting
in only the host player having the ability to perform the completing objective.
