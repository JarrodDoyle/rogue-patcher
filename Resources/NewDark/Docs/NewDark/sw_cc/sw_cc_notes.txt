Software color control (sw_cc) uses shaders to apply gamma and/or saturation/color filter and/or
brightness/contrast. See "d3d_disp_sw_cc" in "new_config_vars.txt" for basic information. This document is
only intended to describe how to override the sw_cc shaders with custom ones.

To make dark load custom sw_cc shaders you just have to place a Direct3D Effects file named "cc.fx" in a
directory named "shaders". The "shaders" directory can be in the game root or a mod/FM path. The effects
file is required to have a number of techniques with predefined names. The best approach is to start with
the "cc.fx" provided along with this documentation. That's the default shader implementation in dark, the
same that it uses when no custom override exists.

If a custom "cc.fx" fails to compile the game's log file will contain the error output. You have load/start
a mission for the effects file to get loaded/compiled.

Included are a couple of examples with different dither/noise algorithms. A brief summary is provided
at the top of each FX file, which can be viewed in any text editor.
