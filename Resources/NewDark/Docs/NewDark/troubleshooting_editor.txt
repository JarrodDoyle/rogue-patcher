Most config vars mentioned here are found in cam_ext.cfg, so if no other
.cfg file is explicitly mentioned, then cam_ext.cfg applies.

Many problems have multiple possible solutions listed. Try each listed
solution one at a time, not all of them at once.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
    Editor crashes, in particular after loading mission or portalizing
    anything (like the default cube), when solid view is enabled.
Problem:
    The 3D view isn't updated after portalization.
Problem:
    The camera marker looks partly miscolored.
Cause:
    The editor is running in software render mode but the editor screen
    depth is set to 32-bit.
Solutions:
    * Stick with software rendering and change bit depth to 16 by setting
      "edit_screen_depth 16" (usually in "dromed.cfg").
    * Enable hardware rendering by specifying/uncommenting "editor_disable_gdi"
      in "dromed.cfg".

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
    Some editor menu entries like Save and Portalize don't do anything.
Cause:
    You used the supplied "menus-sample.cfg" which states that it requires
    the DromEd/ShockEd Toolkit, but you haven't installed the Toolkit.
Solutions:
    * Forget about "menus-sample.cfg" and install the latest Toolkit
      instead.
    * Revert to your old "menus.cfg" and edit it to add functionality
      of updated editor (such as recent files menu, "toggle_lighting"
      instead of "light_bright" and "lit_obj_toggle" etc.).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
    Lines in the viewports look dimmer than normal, or lines of the
    selected brush dims when viewport is updated, when running editor
    with hardware rendering.
Solutions:
    * Disable anti-aliasing (MSAA) support in editor window by disabling
      "d3d_disp_hw2d_msaa" (disabled by default).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
    Some editor hotkeys are not working.
Cause:
     Editor not properly installed or configured, "default.bnd" file
     possibly missing.
Solutions:
    * Make sure "default.bnd" is present, and contains the key bindings
      you expect.
    * Make sure there are no conflicting binds in "user.bnd".

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
    The numeric key pad isn't working to input number in editor input
    fields.
Solution:
    * Make sure num-lock is on.
