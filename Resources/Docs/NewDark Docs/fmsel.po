# FMSel localization template

# INSTALLING: copy a localization file with your language of choice to the same location as "fmsel.dll" and if
#             necessary rename it the same name as the DLL but with a "po" extension, i.e. "fmsel.po".

# po files are in UTF-8 format and are best edited with a GNU gettext editor like poedit (http://www.poedit.net/).
# However note that FMSel does NOT use GNU gettext, it only uses a file format that is minimally compatible to the
# GNU gettext format, in order to allow the same editor tools to be used, but it only supports plain "msgid"
# and "msgstr" tags, no plurals or other features.

# NOTE: Some strings are used in several places but may only have one translation. UI elements will not change
#       size to accomodate different lengths for localized strings so chose translations that roughly fit.
#       Strings that are left empty or omitted in this files will be displayed in english.

# IMPORTANT: All formatting characters (%s, %d etc.) must be retained and be in identical order as the original
#            string or FMSel will crash!
