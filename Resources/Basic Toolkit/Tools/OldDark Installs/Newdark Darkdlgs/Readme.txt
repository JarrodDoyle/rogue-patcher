This is the darkdlgs file from the latest Newdark Release 1.23/2.44.
Just like the Thief2 darkdlgs.dll can replace the Thief1 darkdlgs.dll, the darkdlgs.dll
from Newdark can replace the olddark versions, but isn't guarateed to work perfectly.
Still it seems to be an improvement. Let me know if you have problems.
