Tom's Monolog Viewer
====================

So here's my take on the monolog viewer. It's pretty fast because it
loads as a debugger for Dromed. You still need to open a file, or 
Dromed doesn't print anything. But one of the features of Mono.exe is
appending logs to another file.

Running Mono.exe will prompt you for an executable. Any app will do,
if you happen to have some other program that prints debug messages.

The Mono window will remain open after you exit the application. If 
you close Mono first, the application will be forced to terminate as 
well. Except if you are using Windows XP or Vista. Don't worry, Mono 
will warn you before closing.

For frequent use, you should create a configuration file. Create an 
INI file with a section "Mono". Set the following options:
    exe  : (Required) Executable to run. Can be just the name if 
	       its in the same directory as the configuration file.
           Otherwise, use a full path.
    args : Additional arguments for the program. (Not used by Dromed.)
    log  : Log file. Mono output will be appended to this file.
           Don't use the same name as the monolog file Dromed creates.
           The file is not modified until you close the Mono window.
    stamp: A line that will be printed before anything else. Can contain
           replacement text:
               %1 : The executable name
               %2 : Program arguments
               %3 : Current date (short)
               %4 : Current date (long)
               %5 : Current time
               %6 : Logged-in user name
               %% : A single %
               %! : A single !
               %n : Start a new line

You can change all of this using the menu options.

When you use a configuration file, the size and position of the window
are saved after you close the window. To change the application or log 
files you need to manually save the configuration.

You can easily create a shortcut to Mono.exe and add the name of the 
configuration file to the shortcut command line. (Remember to use a 
full path if it's not in the same directory as Mono.exe.)

Since Dromed only prints debug messages when a monolog file is open, 
you should automatically open it when Dromed starts. Add this line
to you DROMED.CFG file:
    monolog monolog.txt

Use a filename that makes sense for you, and is not the same as the 
permanent log file that Mono.exe writes to. (Dromed's monolog file 
will be erased each time Dromed starts.)

Mono.exe uses Scintilla for displaying text. You need to have the file
Scintilla.dll in the same directory as Mono.exe. This doesn't need to 
be the Dromed directory.
