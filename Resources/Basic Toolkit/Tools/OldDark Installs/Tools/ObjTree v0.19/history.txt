* * To Do
 - Initialize data with default values from StructInfo.
 - Search for property, link, metaprop, stim, receptron.
 - Ins/Del keyboard editing.


* * Known Bugs
 - Changes to a link dest are not reflected in object editors other than the 
   one that created the link editor. The effects are harmless, but annoying.
 - The Object menu doesn't always represent the actual commands available.
   i.e. "Remove ..." is shown even if there's no current selection.

 - Use an object cache to speed-up imports.

 - A simple and buggy version of XML import. 


* * 2004-07-23
 - Full editing capabilities are available, including a simple chunk editor.

 - You know you're spending too much time on a project when you begin 
   keeping a history/todo list.
 - At this point, databases can be read, the properties &c of objects can 
   be listed, some of them can be edited, and reparenting objects is possible.
   It reads StructInfo XML files. And the UI looks pretty snazzy for something
   that doesn't require a behemoth of a class library.

 - The first code for ObjTree (which will likely be renamed later) is first
   written. Just so you know.
