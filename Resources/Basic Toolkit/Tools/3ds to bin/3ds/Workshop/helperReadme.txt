Helper File Readme
==================


Even less is know about these helper files than the editor.

3ds2e.exe
bsp.exe

are used to translate .3ds files into .bin files. These are used for static objects such as lamps, packets of crisps, etc.  You can either use 3dstudio Max to create these objects, or a free model editor such as MilkShape 3d.  One problem you may encounter with not using 3dstudio is texture mapping, objects that you create have to have a uv map else the process will fail.

rtg2e.exe
meshbld.exe

are used to translate .rtg files into .cal and .bi files for AIs.  The only program that can export to rtg that we know of is Alas' Maya, which is beyond the means of most fans.  Due to this, these tools have not yet been used succesfully to create new AIs.
