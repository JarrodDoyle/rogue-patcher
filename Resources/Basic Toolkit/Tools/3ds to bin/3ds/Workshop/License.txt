License agreement

Sorry I have to do this, it's just the world we live in...

Use of any of the components of the Free The Objects tool kit implies
accepting this agreement.

1.) These tools are meant to foster the continuing growth of the Thief
community (and SS2, where applicable). They provide the ability to
convert rather arcane formats into publicly accessible formats. By no means is
this meant to weaken or change in any way the rights of the original or current
owners of the copyright of the 3D objects or artwork. The owners of the
copyright still retain all rights of control of their property.

2.) Under no circumstances should any of these reconsituted objects be used in
a "for profit" venture.

3.) Use of these objects other than where they are currently binary compatible
(Thief versions and SS2) requires authorization from the copyright owners.
