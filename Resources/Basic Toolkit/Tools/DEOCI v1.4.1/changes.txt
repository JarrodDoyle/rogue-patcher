1.4.1
Bug fix: Converted textures always went in the same folder as the 3ds, even when the user selected a different location.

1.4
Removed 'Ignore OBJ.crf/MESH.crf option. It wasn't needed.
Added 'Ignore little crf' option instead. Tafferpatcher combines the two sets of crfs, and some users might have done so manually.

1.3.2
Fixed a texture format bug - would check for a 'format' selection despite 'Don't Convert' being checked
Reinstated a check to ensure a texture conversion program/command has been selected
Added a check to see if the texture conversion program exists
Fixed a bug where on the first instance of the program being run, "model names" were not detected

1.3.1
Fixed a bug that occurred when a source texture was found in obj\txt16 or obj\txt

1.3
Changed the way textures are found. For each texture in the object file, a .dds version is sought, then png, tga and others. This matches NewDark's texture priority feature.
Changed the texture conversion options. Since the extensions don't matter to NewDark, this program now converts all textures to a single format (e.g. png).
Replaced "Don't extract unconverted textures" with "Don't convert/extract textures"
Removed "Texture Format Options" tab due to redundancy.
Updated readme to reflect the above changes.

1.2.1
Open file/folder windows now start in the same location as the current selection - if the selection contains a valid path.

1.2
Allowed text to be pasted/typed into the drop down menus
Improved temp file cleanup - extracted textures had been left behind but now get deleted
Fixed a window size issue caused by larger-than-normal font sizes
Fixed a bug that prevented conversion if the 'object folder' did not match what was in the 'select object' menu.

1.1
Added option to not extract textures that have not been converted
Added option to remember output folders the next time the program is run
Improved pre-convert error handling - in addition to valid selection check from version 1.0, also checks that selected files/folders exist.
Added a message box reporting any textures that could not be found.
Added a message box reporting if BinToE.exe has failed to make a valid .e file - conversion aborts
Temp files cleaned up after (attempted) conversion.
Added a choice of 3 icons for the program shortcut. The 'gear icon' ones are from nightshifter
Texture finding code changed - does not find false positives such as c.dmd, which isn't a texture filename
Fixed a permissions bug that brought up UAC prompts for all write operations rather than just to protected folders.
Changed the Obj.crf labels to remove potential for confusion.
Updated readme.html and associated files
