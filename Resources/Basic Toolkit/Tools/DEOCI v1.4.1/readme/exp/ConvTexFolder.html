<h3>Textures</h3>
<p>Select the folder in which textures are to be placed. It can be useful to select 'same as converted object', because by default most 3D object programs look for textures in the object's own folder. You can however leave the box unchecked and choose a different folder if your object program is configured to look in a specific place.</p>
