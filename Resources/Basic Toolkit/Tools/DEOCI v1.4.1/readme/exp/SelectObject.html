<h3>Select Object</h3>
<p>Use <b>Browse File</b> to select a .bin/.e file. When you do this, the object's folder will automatically be added to the Obj/mesh Folder list below.</p>

<p>Use <b>Model Name</b> to enter in only the name of the file, and the extension. Select .bin for normal objects and .e for AIs. You can get the name by looking in Dromed's Object Hierarchy, editing the object and looking for the Shape > Model Name property. If you don't see it, the value will be inherited, so look for it in one of the parent archetypes instead.</p>

<p>If you use the Model Name option, the program will look for the file in your Obj/Mesh folder, then it will look in EP.crf. Then it will look in obj/mesh.crf and finally OBJ/MESH.CRF</p>
<p>It will stop when it finds the first match.</p>

<p>If <b>Convert to 3ds</b> is uncheked, the program will only convert the textures.</p>
