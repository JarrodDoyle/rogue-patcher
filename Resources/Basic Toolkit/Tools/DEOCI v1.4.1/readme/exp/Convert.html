<h3>Convert</h3>
<p>When everything has been selected, click on Convert. If you've missed anything, you will see an error message telling you what you missed.</p>

<p>Sometimes BinToE is not able to convert a .bin file. After BinToE's error message, this program will produce one of its own, but it won't crash.</p>

<p>The conversion process should be very quick, so you can expect a 'Finished' message almost instantly. You can then import the object into your 3D object program.</p>
