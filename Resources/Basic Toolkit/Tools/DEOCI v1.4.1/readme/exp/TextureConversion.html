<h3>Texture Conversion</h3>
<p>Select the .exe of the program that will convert the textures. IrfanView is a good program to use.</p>

<h3>Conversion Command</h3>
<p>The program you use must have a command line interface. Click on New to define the structure of the command used for converting a single image from one format to another. If you use IrfanView the command structure is:<br> <b>[exe-path] [source-img] /convert=[dest-image]</b> </p>
<p>You must use the placeholder text and the square brackets. Before this program runs the commands it will replace those with the real file locations. The extension of [dest-img] will be set according the the options you choose in the 'Texture Format Options' tab.</p>

<h3>Texture conversion format</h3>
<p>This program may find textures that are in a format not supported by your object program. Use this option to have all textures converted to a format your program does support.</p>

<h3>Don't Convert/Extract Textures</h3>
<p>Select this if you only want the object to be converted. It is useful if you have a whole new set of textures that aren't simple replacements for the original ones.</p>
