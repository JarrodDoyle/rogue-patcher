<h3>Object Conversion</h3>
<p>Locate bintoe.exe and eto3ds.exe. There are a couple of versions around so you can add multiple ones to the list and choose the best one for your needs. For example, the latest versions are usually fine, but when testing I found an object that wasn't textured properly until I used older versions of these tools.</p>
