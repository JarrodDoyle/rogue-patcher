# RoguePatcher

[TTLG Release Thread](https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=152977)

RoguePatcher is a lightweight patcher for installing the latest NewDark releases with a focus on staying as close to vanilla as possible and providing a solid base for both playing fan missions and making them with DromEd. It's a continuation of my previous T1Patcher that was primarily used in the DromEd community to quickly setup T1 DromEd but has been extended with some additional tweaks and mods to make it more useful for casual Thief players.
